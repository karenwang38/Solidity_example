After deploying contract, access function from Remix as folloing:
//ERC20_token is deployed by main account.

1. Access function of Approve then main account give right to spender with 100 token.
2. check Allowance is 100. spender can transfer 100 token that is from main account.

3. account 3 buys token with 1 Eth. use function of Buy.
4. check Balances is 5 because Buy price is 5.

5. main account uses the function withdraw 5 eth from contract address.
6. check eth balance of contract address is reduced by 5 eth.

7. main account use function of Transfer to transfer token to other account.(bug: the number of token is wrong.)

8. main accoutnuse uses Delete Contract Function to remove contract from blockchain and transfer all eth from contract to main account.

Bug
1. the Transfer function with token number problem. the number is not correct.

todo
1. use Geth to excute funcitons again.
	a. how to use geth command to complish payable (assign msg.value : transfer eth to contract address)
	b. withdraw fail on Remix?

2. use truffle and do again.
